# ADR-008: Auditable Documentation Completion

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Template ADR placeholders and missing API docs prevented reviewer traceability across decisions, contracts, and verification evidence.

## Decision

Replace all ADR placeholders (`ADR-001`..`ADR-009`) with concrete context/decision/consequences/related records and add API contract documents under `docs/api/`.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Auditability improves with explicit links to code and tests.
- Reviewer findings can be mapped to immutable decision records.

### Negative

- ADRs require ongoing maintenance as contracts evolve.

### Neutral

- ADR filenames and numbering remain unchanged.
