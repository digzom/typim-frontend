# ADR-003: TypeScript/Node Conventions for Frontend Runtime

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The remediation spans state, events, e2e tests, and tooling. Consistent TypeScript conventions are required for predictable implementation and review.

## Decision

Use TypeScript + npm + Vite/Vitest/Playwright conventions already established in this repository. New runtime contracts are expressed with TypeScript interfaces and validated in tests.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Contract hardening uses compiler checks and runtime tests together.
- Team workflows remain aligned with existing scripts and CI jobs.

### Negative

- Runtime validation is still required for unknown input even with static typing.

### Neutral

- No language migration or cross-runtime adapter is introduced.
