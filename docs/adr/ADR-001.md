# ADR-001: Modular Frontend Boundaries

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The application grew across editor, UI, and share flows. Reviewer findings required deterministic remediation without architecture drift, so module boundaries had to remain explicit during fixes.

## Decision

Keep core runtime contracts in `src/core/`, editor behavior in `src/editor/`, and UI rendering/layout in `src/ui/`. Remediation changes are restricted to existing modules listed in the execution plan.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Auditability improves because each remediation item maps to one module path.
- Rollback is safer because feature behavior remains isolated by module boundary.

### Negative

- Some helper logic remains duplicated until a planned refactor outside this remediation.

### Neutral

- Existing directory structure and import paths stay unchanged.
